The WPILIB FRC framework running on XRP with a mecanum drive.

## Running the Code

To run this:
- Open the project in the usual WPILIB VS Code environment.
- Select 'Build Robot Code'
- Turn on the XRP platform
- Connect laptop to the XRP platform's WiFi AP (XRP-1757-4c35)
- Select 'Simulate Robot Code'
- In the Simulator, drag a joystick controller into the joysticks box
- Select 'Teleop' in the Simulator.
- Drive it around with the joysticks.

(Sometimes the VS Code tools seem to need internet access so connect to a real WiFi if things get stuck, then reconnect to the XRP platform after operations complete.)
